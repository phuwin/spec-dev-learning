# Feature Specification: User Registration

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-registration`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a user registration system for a multi-user todo application. Users should be able to sign up using email/password credentials with JWT token-based authentication. Include input validation for email format and password strength. The system should handle email verification for signups. Focus on simplicity - use built-in JWT tokens instead of external OAuth providers for the MVP. Provide clear error messaging for invalid inputs and duplicate emails."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
- **Constitution compliance**: All specs MUST align with Atomic Design System, TypeScript-first development, and TDD principles

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A new user needs to create an account for the multi-user todo application by providing their email address and password, so they can access the workspace and collaborate on tasks with their team.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the registration page, **When** they enter a valid email and strong password, **Then** they receive a verification email and can complete registration
2. **Given** a user enters an invalid email format, **When** they submit the registration form, **Then** they see a clear error message about email format requirements
3. **Given** a user enters a weak password, **When** they submit the registration form, **Then** they see a clear error message about password strength requirements
4. **Given** a user tries to register with an existing email, **When** they submit the registration form, **Then** they see a clear error message about email already being in use
5. **Given** a user clicks the verification link in their email, **When** they complete the verification process, **Then** their account is activated and they can log in

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the verification email fails to send?
- How does the system handle users who don't verify their email within a reasonable time?
- What happens when a user tries to register multiple times with the same email?
- How does the system handle network errors during registration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to register with email and password
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate email format (proper email structure)
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate password strength (minimum length, complexity requirements)
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent duplicate email registrations
- **FR-005**: System MUST send verification email after successful registration
- **FR-006**: System MUST require email verification before account activation
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages for duplicate emails
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate JWT token upon successful verification
- **FR-010**: System MUST store user credentials securely (hashed passwords)
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle registration form validation in real-time
- **FR-012**: System MUST redirect users to appropriate page after successful registration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a user account with email, hashed password, verification status, and creation timestamp
- **VerificationToken**: Represents a temporary token for email verification with expiration and user association
