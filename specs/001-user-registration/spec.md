# Feature Specification: User Registration

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-registration`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a user registration system for a multi-user todo application. Users should be able to sign up using email/password credentials with JWT token-based authentication. Include input validation for email format and password strength. The system should handle email verification for signups. Focus on simplicity - use built-in JWT tokens instead of external OAuth providers for the MVP. Provide clear error messaging for invalid inputs and duplicate emails."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
- **Constitution compliance**: All specs MUST align with Atomic Design System, TypeScript-first development, and TDD principles

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A new user needs to create an account for the multi-user todo application by providing their email address and password, so they can immediately access the workspace and collaborate on tasks with their team.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the registration page, **When** they enter a valid email and strong password, **Then** their account is created and they are logged in automatically
2. **Given** a user enters an invalid email format, **When** they submit the registration form, **Then** they see a clear error message about email format requirements
3. **Given** a user enters a weak password, **When** they submit the registration form, **Then** they see a clear error message about password strength requirements
4. **Given** a user tries to register with an existing email, **When** they submit the registration form, **Then** they see a clear error message about email already being in use
5. **Given** a user successfully registers, **When** they complete the registration process, **Then** they are redirected to the dashboard and can start using the application

### Edge Cases
- When user tries to register with existing email: System shows clear error message about email already in use
- When network errors occur during registration: System shows appropriate error message and allows retry
- When user provides invalid email format: System shows real-time validation error
- When user provides weak password: System shows real-time validation error

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to register with email and password
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate email format (proper email structure)
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate password strength (8+ characters, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character)
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent duplicate email registrations
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear error messages for duplicate emails
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate JWT token upon successful registration
- **FR-008**: System MUST store user credentials securely (hashed passwords)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle registration form validation in real-time
- **FR-010**: System MUST redirect users to dashboard after successful registration
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically log in users after successful registration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a user account with email, hashed password, and creation timestamp

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What are the minimum password strength requirements? ‚Üí A: 8+ characters, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character
- Q: Should there be rate limiting on registration attempts? ‚Üí A: No rate limiting needed for MVP
- Q: Where should users be redirected after successful registration? ‚Üí A: Remove email verification requirement
