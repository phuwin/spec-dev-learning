# Implementation Plan: User Registration

**Branch**: `001-user-registration` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-user-registration/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-user-registration/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build a user registration system for a multi-user todo application with email/password authentication, JWT tokens, real-time validation, and automatic login. The system will use React 19 with TypeScript, Vite 7, and Tailwind CSS v4 for the frontend, with a Node.js backend using JWT authentication and secure password hashing. No email verification required for MVP.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, Node.js 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS v4, Node.js, Express, JWT, bcrypt  
**Storage**: Local database (SQLite for MVP)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest  
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser-based)  
**Project Type**: Web (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response, <3s initial page load, <500KB bundle size  
**Constraints**: MVP simplicity, no external services, built-in JWT tokens  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user todo application, 100+ concurrent users

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Atomic Design System Compliance

### AI-Assisted Development Workflow
- [x] Spec written before implementation
- [x] Agent personas (Archimedes fullstack) used for system design
- [x] .specify template system followed
- [x] spec → plan → tasks → implementation flow maintained

### Logical Documentation Consistency
- [x] Feature spec in `docs/specs/` describes function needed
- [x] TypeScript types in `src/types/` for data items
- [x] OpenAPI spec in `docs/specs/openapi/` using the types
- [x] Database implementation in `src/server/` matches types
- [x] Server implementation in `src/server/` matches OpenAPI spec
- [x] Client uses types and API for backend communication
- [x] Client implements user flows from Gherkin scenarios
- [x] Single source of truth maintained (no duplicate content)

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with separate frontend and backend directories. Frontend uses atomic design principles with existing component structure, backend follows MVC pattern with clear separation of concerns.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Specific Tasks to Generate**:
1. **Contract Tests** [P]: Create failing tests for register API endpoint
2. **Data Model** [P]: Create User entity with TypeScript interfaces
3. **Backend Setup**: Express server with auth routes
4. **Database Setup**: SQLite schema and migrations
5. **Auth Service**: JWT token generation and password hashing
6. **API Implementation**: Register endpoint with validation
7. **Frontend Types**: TypeScript interfaces for API communication
8. **Form Components**: Registration form with atomic design
9. **Validation Logic**: Real-time form validation
10. **API Integration**: Frontend service for registration
11. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
12. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end registration flow
13. **Documentation**: Update README and API docs

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
