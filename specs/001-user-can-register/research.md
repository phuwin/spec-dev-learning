# Research: User Registration and Login

**Feature**: 001-user-can-register  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Scope**: Frontend MVP with localStorage authentication

## Research Findings

### 1. Frontend Authentication Patterns

**Decision**: localStorage-based mock authentication  
**Rationale**: 
- MVP requirement to avoid backend complexity
- localStorage provides persistent storage across browser sessions
- Simple implementation for demonstration purposes
- No external dependencies or service failures

**Alternatives considered**:
- Session storage: Lost on browser close, not suitable for "remember me" functionality
- IndexedDB: Overkill for simple user data storage
- External auth services: Violates MVP simplicity principle
- Backend implementation: Outside scope of frontend MVP

### 2. Form Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Client-side validation with basic email format checking  
**Rationale**:
- No password strength requirements (per clarifications)
- Basic email validation sufficient for MVP
- Real-time validation improves user experience
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-side validation: Not applicable for frontend-only MVP
- Complex regex patterns: Unnecessary for basic email validation
- No validation: Poor user experience

### 3. State Management Approach

**Decision**: React Context + useState for authentication state  
**Rationale**:
- Simple state management for MVP scope
- No need for complex state libraries (Redux, Zustand)
- Context provides global auth state access
- useState sufficient for form state management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux: Overkill for simple auth state
- Zustand: Additional dependency not needed
- Local component state only: Difficult to share auth state across components

### 4. Component Architecture

**Decision**: Atomic Design System with Radix UI primitives  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for atomic design
- Radix UI provides accessible, unstyled primitives
- Reusable components reduce development time
- Clear hierarchy: atoms → molecules → organisms → pages

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom components: Violates atomic design principles
- Other UI libraries: Radix UI specified in constitution
- No component system: Poor maintainability and reusability

### 5. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Vitest + React Testing Library for comprehensive testing  
**Rationale**:
- Vitest is fast and modern testing framework
- React Testing Library focuses on user behavior testing
- TDD approach requires robust testing infrastructure
- Integration tests for complete user flows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Vitest is faster and more modern
- Enzyme: React Testing Library is more user-focused
- Manual testing only: Insufficient for TDD approach

### 6. TypeScript Type Definitions

**Decision**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for TypeScript-first development
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Interfaces document data structures clearly
- Strict mode catches potential issues early

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript: Violates TypeScript-first principle
- Loose TypeScript: Reduces type safety benefits
- Any types: Violates constitution requirements

## Implementation Notes

- All user data stored in localStorage with clear key naming
- Session persistence until explicit logout
- Error handling for localStorage quota exceeded
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance optimization with React.memo where appropriate

## Dependencies

- React 19: Latest React with concurrent features
- Vite 7: Fast build tool and dev server
- Tailwind CSS v4: Utility-first CSS framework
- Radix UI: Accessible component primitives
- Vitest: Fast testing framework
- React Testing Library: User-focused testing utilities
