# Implementation Plan: User Registration and Login

**Branch**: `001-user-can-register` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-user-can-register/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Frontend MVP for user registration and login with email/password authentication. No backend implementation - uses localStorage for mock authentication. Users can register new accounts, log in with existing credentials, and maintain sessions until explicit logout.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with React 19  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI primitives  
**Storage**: localStorage for user accounts and sessions  
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Jest  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (modern ES2020+)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend-only MVP)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial page load, <200ms form interactions  
**Constraints**: No external dependencies, localStorage only, offline-capable  
**Scale/Scope**: MVP for demonstration, single-page application

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Atomic Design System Compliance
- [x] All UI components follow atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages hierarchy
- [x] Components use Radix UI primitives as foundation
- [x] No custom components without atomic design justification
- [x] Components are reusable and composable

### TypeScript-First Development
- [x] All code written in TypeScript with strict type checking
- [x] No `any` types without explicit justification
- [x] Interfaces defined for all data structures
- [x] Type safety maintained throughout

### Test-Driven Development
- [x] TDD approach planned: Tests → User approval → Tests fail → Implementation
- [x] Unit tests planned for every component
- [x] Integration tests planned for user flows
- [x] Contract tests planned for API boundaries (frontend-only, localStorage contracts)

### Modern Web Standards
- [x] React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS v4, latest TypeScript specified
- [x] Performance targets defined: <200ms form interactions, <3s page load
- [x] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) planned
- [x] Responsive design for all screen sizes

### AI-Assisted Development Workflow
- [x] Spec written before implementation
- [x] Agent personas (Archimedes fullstack) used for system design
- [x] .specify template system followed
- [x] spec → plan → tasks → implementation flow maintained

### Logical Documentation Consistency
- [x] Feature spec in `docs/specs/` describes function needed
- [x] TypeScript types in `src/types/` for data items
- [x] Frontend contracts in `src/client/` for localStorage operations
- [x] Client implements user flows from Gherkin scenarios
- [x] Single source of truth maintained (no duplicate content)

**Structure Decision**: Frontend-only MVP using existing project structure. Components follow atomic design hierarchy. Services handle localStorage operations. Types define data structures. Tests cover unit and integration scenarios.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
