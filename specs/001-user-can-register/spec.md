# Feature Specification: User Registration and Login

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-can-register`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "user can register and login with email and password. No verification needed"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
- **Constitution compliance**: All specs MUST align with Atomic Design System, TypeScript-first development, and TDD principles

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: What should be the minimum password requirements? ‚Üí A: D (No password requirements - accept any non-empty password)
- Q: How long should user login sessions remain active? ‚Üí A: A (Until user explicitly logs out)
- Q: How should the frontend handle user authentication without a backend? ‚Üí A: A (Mock authentication - store credentials in localStorage, simulate login/register)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new user, I want to create an account with my email and password so that I can access the application and its features.

As an existing user, I want to log in with my email and password so that I can access my account and continue using the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I provide a valid email and password, **Then** I should be able to create an account and be automatically logged in
2. **Given** I have an existing account, **When** I provide my correct email and password, **Then** I should be able to log in and access the application
3. **Given** I am on the registration page, **When** I provide an email that already exists, **Then** I should see an error message indicating the email is already registered
4. **Given** I am on the login page, **When** I provide incorrect credentials, **Then** I should see an error message indicating invalid credentials
5. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I want to log out, **Then** I should be able to log out and return to the login page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to register with an invalid email format?
- What happens when a user tries to register with a weak password?
- What happens when a user tries to log in with an email that doesn't exist?
- What happens when a user tries to log in with the wrong password?
- What happens when a user tries to register with an empty email or password?
- How does the system handle concurrent login attempts from the same user?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Frontend MUST allow new users to create accounts using email and password (stored in localStorage)
- **FR-002**: Frontend MUST allow existing users to log in using email and password (validated against localStorage)
- **FR-003**: Frontend MUST validate email format during registration (basic @ validation)
- **FR-004**: Frontend MUST accept any non-empty password during registration
- **FR-005**: Frontend MUST prevent duplicate email registrations (check localStorage)
- **FR-006**: Frontend MUST authenticate users with correct email and password combination (validate against localStorage)
- **FR-007**: Frontend MUST reject login attempts with incorrect credentials
- **FR-008**: Frontend MUST provide clear error messages for failed registration attempts
- **FR-009**: Frontend MUST provide clear error messages for failed login attempts
- **FR-010**: Frontend MUST allow users to log out of their accounts (clear localStorage session)
- **FR-011**: Frontend MUST maintain user session after successful login until user explicitly logs out (persist in localStorage)
- **FR-012**: Frontend MUST persist user account data in localStorage
- **FR-013**: Frontend MUST handle empty or missing email/password fields gracefully

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents a registered user with email, password, and account status (stored in localStorage)
- **User Session**: Represents an active user login session with authentication state (stored in localStorage)
- **Registration Attempt**: Represents a user's attempt to create a new account (validated against localStorage)
- **Login Attempt**: Represents a user's attempt to authenticate with existing credentials (validated against localStorage)
