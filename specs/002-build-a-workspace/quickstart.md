# Quickstart: Workspace Creation System

**Feature**: 002-build-a-workspace  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This quickstart guide demonstrates the workspace creation system functionality through user scenarios and test validation steps.

## Prerequisites

- User must be authenticated (existing authentication system)
- Browser with local storage support
- Development environment with React, TypeScript, and testing tools

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create a New Workspace

**Given** I am an authenticated user  
**When** I navigate to the workspace creation page  
**Then** I should see a workspace creation form with name and description fields

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/workspaces/create`
2. Verify form is displayed with:
   - Name input field (required)
   - Description textarea (optional)
   - Create button
3. Fill in workspace name: "My Team Workspace"
4. Fill in description: "A workspace for our development team"
5. Click "Create Workspace"
6. Verify success message: "Workspace 'My Team Workspace' created successfully"
7. Verify redirect to workspace settings page
8. Verify workspace appears in user's workspace list

### Scenario 2: Create Workspace with Duplicate Name

**Given** I am an authenticated user  
**And** a workspace named "Existing Workspace" already exists  
**When** I try to create a workspace with the same name  
**Then** I should see a validation error

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/workspaces/create`
2. Fill in workspace name: "Existing Workspace"
3. Fill in description: "This should fail"
4. Click "Create Workspace"
5. Verify error message: "Workspace name 'Existing Workspace' is already taken"
6. Verify form remains on creation page
7. Verify form data is preserved

### Scenario 3: Create Workspace with Empty Name

**Given** I am an authenticated user  
**When** I try to create a workspace with an empty name  
**Then** I should see a validation error

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/workspaces/create`
2. Leave name field empty
3. Fill in description: "This should fail"
4. Click "Create Workspace"
5. Verify error message: "Workspace name is required"
6. Verify form remains on creation page
7. Verify form data is preserved

### Scenario 4: Update Workspace Settings

**Given** I am a workspace admin  
**When** I navigate to workspace settings  
**Then** I should be able to update workspace name and description

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/settings`
2. Verify settings form is displayed with:
   - Current workspace name
   - Current workspace description
   - Save button
3. Update workspace name to: "Updated Workspace Name"
4. Update description to: "Updated description"
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Verify success message: "Workspace settings updated successfully"
7. Verify changes are reflected in the form
8. Navigate to workspace list and verify updated name

### Scenario 5: Access Workspace Settings as Non-Admin

**Given** I am an authenticated user  
**And** I am not an admin of the workspace  
**When** I try to access workspace settings  
**Then** I should be denied access

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/settings` where user is not admin
2. Verify access denied message: "You don't have permission to access this workspace"
3. Verify redirect to workspace list or dashboard

## Test Validation Steps

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run workspace service tests
npm test workspace-service.test.ts

# Run component tests
npm test WorkspaceForm.test.tsx
npm test WorkspaceSettings.test.tsx
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run workspace creation flow tests
npm test workspace-creation.integration.test.ts

# Run workspace settings flow tests
npm test workspace-settings.integration.test.ts
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Workspace creation form displays correctly
- [ ] Form validation works for empty name
- [ ] Form validation works for duplicate name
- [ ] Workspace is created successfully with valid data
- [ ] Creator becomes workspace admin automatically
- [ ] Workspace settings page displays for admins
- [ ] Workspace settings can be updated
- [ ] Non-admins cannot access workspace settings
- [ ] Workspace list displays user's workspaces
- [ ] Global name uniqueness is enforced
- [ ] Local storage persistence works correctly

## Expected Behavior

### Success Cases
- Workspace creation with valid data
- Workspace settings update by admin
- Workspace list display for authenticated users

### Error Cases
- Empty workspace name validation
- Duplicate workspace name validation
- Unauthorized access to workspace settings
- Non-existent workspace access

### Performance Expectations
- Form submission response < 200ms
- Page load time < 3s
- Smooth user interactions with no lag

## Data Validation Rules

1. **Workspace Name**:
   - Required field
   - Cannot be empty
   - Must be globally unique
   - No length restrictions (MVP)

2. **Workspace Description**:
   - Optional field
   - Can be empty
   - No length restrictions (MVP)

3. **Admin Permissions**:
   - Creator automatically becomes admin
   - Admins can update name and description only
   - Non-admins cannot access settings

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Local Storage Keys

- `workspaces:{workspaceId}` - Individual workspace data
- `workspace_names` - Array of all workspace names for uniqueness checking
- `workspace_admins:{workspaceId}` - Admin relationships
