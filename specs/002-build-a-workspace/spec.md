# Feature Specification: Workspace Creation System

**Feature Branch**: `002-build-a-workspace`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a workspace creation system where authenticated users can create team workspaces with custom names and settings. Workspace creators become admins with full permissions. Include basic workspace settings like name, description, and privacy level. Focus on simple workspace setup with clear admin permissions."

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: Workspace Name Uniqueness Scope: When preventing duplicate workspace names, what should be the scope of uniqueness? ‚Üí A: Globally unique across all users (only one workspace can have a specific name)
- Q: Privacy Level Options: What specific privacy levels should be available for workspace selection? ‚Üí A: All workspaces are public by default (no privacy levels needed)
- Q: Workspace Name Validation Rules: What specific format and length constraints should apply to workspace names? ‚Üí A: Cannot be empty only
- Q: Workspace Creation Limits: Should there be any limits on how many workspaces a single user can create? ‚Üí A: No limits (users can create unlimited workspaces)
- Q: Workspace Settings Scope: What specific settings should workspace admins be able to modify after creation? ‚Üí A: Name and description only

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
- **Constitution compliance**: All specs MUST align with Atomic Design System and TypeScript-first development principles

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user, I want to create a team workspace with custom settings so that I can collaborate with my team in a dedicated space where I have full administrative control.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an authenticated user, **When** I navigate to workspace creation, **Then** I can access the workspace creation form
2. **Given** I am on the workspace creation form, **When** I provide a workspace name and description, **Then** I can select a privacy level and create the workspace
3. **Given** I successfully create a workspace, **When** the workspace is created, **Then** I am automatically assigned as the admin with full permissions
4. **Given** I am a workspace admin, **When** I access workspace settings, **Then** I can modify workspace name, description, and privacy level
5. **Given** I attempt to create a workspace, **When** I provide invalid data (empty name, invalid characters), **Then** I receive clear validation errors

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a workspace with a name that already exists?
- How does the system handle workspace creation when the user's account has restrictions?
- What happens if workspace creation fails due to system errors?
- How does the system handle concurrent workspace creation attempts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create new team workspaces
- **FR-002**: System MUST require workspace name as a mandatory field during creation
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow workspace description as an optional field during creation
- **FR-004**: System MUST create all workspaces as public by default
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically assign workspace creator as admin with full permissions
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that workspace name is not empty
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent duplicate workspace names globally across all users
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow workspace admins to modify workspace name and description after creation
- **FR-009**: System MUST display clear error messages for validation failures
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist workspace data after successful creation
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide workspace settings interface for admins to modify name and description
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce admin-only access to workspace settings modification

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workspace**: Represents a team collaboration space with name, description, and admin permissions
- **Workspace Admin**: Represents a user with full permissions to manage workspace name and description
- **Privacy Level**: All workspaces are public by default (no privacy level selection needed)
