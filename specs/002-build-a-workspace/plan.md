# Implementation Plan: Workspace Creation System

**Branch**: `002-build-a-workspace` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-build-a-workspace/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build a workspace creation system where authenticated users can create team workspaces with custom names and settings. Workspace creators become admins with full permissions. All workspaces are public by default with globally unique names. Focus on simple workspace setup with clear admin permissions for name and description management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, React 19, Vite 7  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI primitives, React Hook Form, Zod validation  
**Storage**: Local storage for MVP (no external database)  
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW for API mocking  
**Target Platform**: Web browser (responsive design)  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend simulation)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response, <3s initial page load  
**Constraints**: MVP simplicity, no external dependencies, atomic design compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Unlimited workspaces per user, globally unique names

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Atomic Design System Compliance
- [x] All UI components follow atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages hierarchy
- [x] Components use Radix UI primitives as foundation
- [x] No custom components without atomic design justification
- [x] Components are reusable and composable

### TypeScript-First Development
- [x] All code written in TypeScript with strict type checking
- [x] No `any` types without explicit justification
- [x] Interfaces defined for all data structures
- [x] Type safety maintained throughout

### Testing Standards
- [x] Unit tests planned for critical components
- [x] Integration tests planned for user flows
- [x] Contract tests planned for API boundaries
- [x] Testing approach aligns with project requirements

### Modern Web Standards
- [x] React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS v4, latest TypeScript specified
- [x] Performance targets defined: <200ms API response, <3s page load
- [x] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) planned
- [x] Responsive design for all screen sizes

### AI-Assisted Development Workflow
- [x] Spec written before implementation
- [x] Agent personas (Archimedes fullstack) used for system design
- [x] .specify template system followed
- [x] spec → plan → tasks → implementation flow maintained

### Logical Documentation Consistency (MVP Frontend-Only)
- [x] Feature spec in `specs/002-build-a-workspace/` describes function needed
- [x] TypeScript types in `src/types/` for data items
- [x] Service contracts in `specs/002-build-a-workspace/contracts/` using the types
- [x] Local storage service in `src/services/` matches types
- [x] Service implementation in `src/services/` matches contracts
- [x] Client uses types and services for data management
- [x] Client implements user flows from Gherkin scenarios
- [x] Single source of truth maintained (no duplicate content)

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with atomic design components. Frontend-only implementation using local storage for MVP simplicity, following the existing project structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Testing setup before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Specific Tasks to Generate**:
1. **Type Definitions** [P]: Create workspace types in `src/types/workspace.ts`
2. **Service Contract Tests** [P]: Implement workspace service contract tests
3. **Validation Utils** [P]: Create workspace validation utilities
4. **Workspace Service** [P]: Implement workspace service with local storage
5. **Form Components**: Create WorkspaceForm organism component
6. **Settings Components**: Create WorkspaceSettings organism component
7. **List Components**: Create WorkspaceList organism component
8. **Page Components**: Create workspace pages
9. **Integration Tests**: Create end-to-end workspace flow tests
10. **Hook Implementation**: Create useWorkspace hook

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
