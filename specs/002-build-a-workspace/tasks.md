# Tasks: Workspace Creation System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-build-a-workspace/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Testing setup before implementation
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Dependencies
- T001 blocks T002 (types before validation)
- T002 blocks T011 (validation before service)
- T011 blocks T012-T014 (service before components)
- T012 blocks T016 (form before page)
- T013 blocks T017 (settings component before page)
- T014 blocks T018 (list component before page)
- T015 blocks T016-T018 (hook before pages)
- T019 blocks T020-T021 (routes before integration)
- T020 blocks T021 (auth integration before navigation)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T005-T010 together (testing setup):
Task: "Set up testing framework and configuration for workspace components"
Task: "Create test utilities and helpers for workspace testing"
Task: "Set up unit test structure for workspace components"
Task: "Set up integration test structure for workspace flows"
Task: "Set up contract test structure for workspace service"
Task: "Create test data fixtures for workspace scenarios"

Task: "Create WorkspaceListPage in src/components/pages/WorkspaceListPage.tsx"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Follow atomic design principles for components
- Use existing project patterns for consistency

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - workspace-service.ts → T010 contract test task [P]
   - WorkspaceService interface → T011 implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Workspace entity → T001 model creation task
   - WorkspaceAdmin entity → T001 model creation task
   - Validation rules → T002 validation utilities task
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Create workspace story → T008 integration test [P]
   - Update workspace story → T009 integration test [P]
   - Access control story → T009 integration test [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Testing Setup → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (workspace-service.ts → T010)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (Workspace, WorkspaceAdmin → T001)
- [x] Testing setup completed before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
