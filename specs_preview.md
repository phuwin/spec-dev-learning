## Phase 1: Foundation (Specs 1-4)

### Spec 1: User Registration

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Build a user registration system for a multi-user todo application. Users should be able to sign up using email/password credentials with JWT token-based authentication. Include input validation for email format and password strength. The system should handle email verification for signups.

```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ TypeScript-first development
- ✅ MVP Simplicity (JWT instead of OAuth)
- ✅ TDD approach for registration flows

---

### Spec 2: User Login

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Create a user login system that allows registered users to authenticate using email/password credentials. The system should maintain secure user sessions with JWT tokens. Include password reset functionality via email. Provide clear error messaging for invalid logins or session issues. The authentication should work seamlessly with a React frontend and redirect users to their dashboard after successful login.
```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ TypeScript-first development
- ✅ MVP Simplicity (JWT tokens)
- ✅ TDD approach for login flows

---

### Spec 3: Workspace Creation

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:

Include basic workspace settings like name, description, and privacy level. Focus on simple workspace setup with clear admin permissions.
```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for workspace entities
- ✅ TDD for workspace creation
- ✅ MVP Simplicity (no external services)

---

### Spec 4: User Invitation System

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Create a user invitation system where workspace admins can invite users by email address. The system should send invitation emails and allow users to accept or decline invitations. Prevent duplicate invitations and handle edge cases like invalid email addresses. Focus on simple email integration using basic SMTP rather than complex third-party services for the MVP.
```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ MVP Simplicity (basic SMTP instead of external services)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for invitation entities
- ✅ TDD for invitation flows

- ✅ TDD for task creation

---

### Spec 6: Task Editing & Deletion

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Create a task editing and deletion system where users can update task details, change due dates, modify descriptions, and delete tasks. Users should be able to mark tasks as complete or reopen them. Include proper permissions so users can only edit tasks they created or are assigned to. Provide immediate visual feedback on status changes and confirmations for destructive actions.
```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for task entities
- ✅ TDD for task editing operations
- ✅ Modern Web Standards (React 19, accessibility)

---

### Spec 7: Task Assignment

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Implement task assignment functionality where users can assign tasks to one or more team members from their workspace. The system should provide autocomplete/select functionality for choosing assignees from the workspace roster. Users should be able to reassign tasks and see who tasks are assigned to. Focus on simple, intuitive assignment workflows with clear visual indicators of task ownership.
```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for assignment entities
- ✅ TDD for assignment flows
- ✅ Atomic Design System for assignment components

---

### Spec 8: Task Dashboard

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Create a task dashboard that displays all tasks assigned to the user and tasks they've created. Include basic filtering by status (completed, pending) and sorting by due date or priority. The dashboard should provide a clean, organized view with clear task status indicators. Focus on intuitive task organization and quick access to task details.
```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ Atomic Design System (dashboard components)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for dashboard data
- ✅ TDD for dashboard functionality

---

## Phase 3: Collaboration Features (Specs 9-12)

### Spec 9: Task Comments

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Add commenting functionality to tasks where users can add comments for communication and clarification. Comments should show who posted them and when, with timestamps. Users should be able to edit and delete their own comments but not others'. Comments should be displayed in inline threads under each task. Include proper input validation and character limits for comments.
```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for comment entities
- ✅ TDD for comment management
- ✅ Atomic Design System for comment components

---

### Spec 10: Real-Time Updates

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Implement real-time updates so task changes sync instantly across all team members. Use WebSocket connections instead of third-party real-time services for the MVP. Include real-time updates for task assignments, completions, and comments. Focus on reliable, simple real-time synchronization without external dependencies.
```

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ✅ MVP Simplicity (WebSocket instead of third-party services)
- ✅ Real-time updates with built-in solutions
- ✅ TDD for real-time functionality

---

### Spec 11: Task Filtering

**Command**: `/specify`

**Input**:
```
Create task filtering capabilities where users can filter tasks by assignee, status, due date, or priority level.
